# Benchmarks and Validation

This document tracks validation efforts to prove that rec-praxis-rlm delivers on its core value proposition: **experience-based learning for autonomous agents**.

## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ Week 1 Complete (Dogfooding + RAGAS Foundation)

**Key Findings**:
1. ✅ RLM Context grep/peek/tail/safe_exec work correctly on realistic logs
2. ✅ Procedural memory recalls relevant experiences with hybrid similarity
3. ✅ Temporal ordering works (newest successful experiences prioritized)
4. ✅ RAGAS framework integrated for reproducible benchmarking

**Next Steps**:
- Add full RAGAS evaluation with LLM judge (requires OpenAI API key)
- Create learning demo showing improvement over multiple log files
- Validate 60/40 env/goal weighting with ablation study

## Dogfooding: Log Analyzer

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Script**: `dogfood_log_analyzer.py`
**Log**: `sample_application.log` (4,799 bytes, 71 lines, realistic error patterns)

### Test Results

| Feature | Test | Result |
|---------|------|--------|
| **grep** | Find database errors | ✅ Found 5/5 errors |
| **grep** | Find SafeExecutor blocks | ✅ Found 4/4 blocks |
| **safe_exec** | Analyze error distribution | ✅ Correctly counted: Database (5), SafeExecutor (4), etc. |
| **safe_exec** | Count timeout events | ✅ Found 4 timeout events |
| **grep** | Find degraded mode | ✅ Found 2 degraded mode + 3 fallback events |
| **peek** | Extract context around error | ✅ Retrieved 200 chars around error |
| **tail** | Get last log lines | ✅ Retrieved last 5 lines |
| **ReDoS protection** | Allow legitimate patterns | ✅ No false positives on safe regex |
| **Sandbox security** | Block imports | ✅ Blocked `import re` correctly |

**Performance**:
- Total execution time: <2s for 4,799 byte log
- grep searches: <50ms each
- safe_exec operations: <100ms each
- No false positives from security blocks

**Key Insight**: RLM Context provides efficient document inspection without loading entire files into LLM context. Safe execution enables on-the-fly analysis without external dependencies.

## RAGAS Benchmarks: Procedural Memory

**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Script**: `tests/test_ragas_procedural_memory.py`
**Framework**: RAGAS 0.4.0

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Web Scraping Experience Recall

**Setup**:
- 3 stored experiences (BeautifulSoup static, BeautifulSoup dynamic [failed], Selenium dynamic)
- Query: "I need to scrape a website that loads data dynamically with JavaScript"
- Expected: Recall Selenium experience (handles JavaScript)

**Results**:
- ✅ Retrieved 3 relevant contexts
- ✅ Recalled Selenium + WebDriverWait experience
- ✅ Answer mentioned correct approach

**Metrics** (Manual validation, pending LLM judge):
- Context Recall: 3/3 relevant experiences retrieved (100%)
- Context Precision: TBD (requires RAGAS LLM evaluation)
- Faithfulness: TBD (requires RAGAS LLM evaluation)

---

#### Scenario 2: Database Optimization Recall

**Setup**:
- 3 stored experiences (single index, composite index, caching [partial success])
- Query: "Our database query is taking 5+ seconds on a 1M row table"
- Expected: Recall composite index + EXPLAIN ANALYZE experience

**Results**:
- ✅ Retrieved 3 relevant contexts
- ✅ Recalled EXPLAIN ANALYZE + composite index solution
- ✅ Answer mentioned correct optimization path

**Metrics** (Manual validation):
- Context Recall: 3/3 relevant experiences (100%)
- Context Precision: TBD
- Faithfulness: TBD

---

#### Scenario 3: Temporal Conflict Resolution

**Setup**:
- 3 stored experiences across 30 days:
  - Day 1: `/api/v1/users` with basic auth [success]
  - Day 15: `/api/v1/users` [failed, deprecated]
  - Day 29: `/api/v3/users` with bearer token [success]
- Query: "What's the correct API endpoint to fetch user data?"
- Expected: Return v3 endpoint (newest), not v1 (outdated)

**Results**:
- ✅ Retrieved 3 relevant contexts (all API experiences)
- ✅ Prioritized most recent successful experience (v3)
- ✅ Answer mentioned `/api/v3/users` with bearer token
- ✅ Did NOT suggest outdated v1 endpoint

**Metrics** (Manual validation):
- Temporal Correctness: ✅ Newest experience prioritized
- Context Recall: 3/3 API experiences (100%)
- Context Precision: TBD
- Faithfulness: TBD

**Key Insight**: Procedural memory's timestamp-based sorting ensures agents don't suggest outdated solutions. This validates the "newest wins" temporal resolution pattern from HMLR.

## Comparison to HMLR

rec-praxis-rlm is NOT competing with HMLR's conversation memory. We're targeting a different niche: **developer tools** (log analysis, code review, security audit).

| Feature | HMLR | rec-praxis-rlm | Status |
|---------|------|----------------|--------|
| **Conversation Memory** | ✅ Bridge Blocks, temporal resolution | ❌ Not our focus | Different niche |
| **Procedural Memory** | ❌ Not present | ✅ Experience-based learning | Our core strength |
| **Semantic Memory** | ✅ FactScrubber (Definitions, Acronyms, etc.) | ⏳ Planned (add FactStore) | Week 2 roadmap |
| **RLM Context** | ❌ Not present | ✅ grep/peek/safe_exec | Our unique feature |
| **RAGAS Benchmarks** | ✅ Perfect scores (1.00/1.00) | ⏳ Foundation complete, LLM judge pending | In progress |
| **LLM Requirements** | gpt-4.1-mini | Works without LLM (SentenceTransformers) | Cost advantage |

**Positioning**: "Multi-Modal Memory for DSPy Agents" - Procedural + RLM + (soon) Semantic

## Performance Benchmarks

### Memory Retrieval (from existing tests)

| Operation | Dataset Size | Without FAISS | With FAISS | Speedup |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| recall() | 1,000 exp | <20ms | <3ms | 6.7x |
| recall() | 10,000 exp | <200ms | <20ms | 10x |
| recall() | 100,000 exp | ~2s | ~100ms | 20x |

*Source: Existing test suite (327 tests, 99.38% coverage)*

### RLM Context Operations (from dogfooding)

| Operation | Input Size | Time | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|------|-------|
| add_document() | 4.8KB | <1ms | In-memory storage |
| grep() | 4.8KB | <50ms | ReDoS protection enabled |
| safe_exec() | 4.8KB | <100ms | Full AST validation + sandbox |
| peek() | 4.8KB | <5ms | Direct string slicing |
| head()/tail() | 4.8KB | <5ms | Line extraction |

**Scalability Target**: 10MB logs in <500ms (to be validated in Week 2)

## Next Steps: Full RAGAS Evaluation

To achieve HMLR-level validation, we need:

### 1. LLM Judge Integration

```python
# Example: Full RAGAS evaluation with GPT-4o-mini
from ragas import evaluate
from ragas.metrics import faithfulness, context_recall, context_precision

result = evaluate(
    dataset=ragas_dataset,
    metrics=[faithfulness, context_recall, context_precision],
    llm="gpt-4o-mini",  # Cheap and fast for evaluation
    embeddings="text-embedding-3-small"
)

print(result)
# Target: Faithfulness >= 0.95, Context Recall >= 0.90
```

### 2. Adversarial Test Suite

Expand test scenarios to include:
- **Multi-hop reasoning**: "How did we solve X, and did that approach work for Y?"
- **Cross-domain transfer**: "We optimized database queries. Can we apply similar patterns to API calls?"
- **Failure mode learning**: "What approaches did NOT work for problem Z?"

### 3. Ablation Study: 60/40 Weighting

Validate env_weight=0.6, goal_weight=0.4 hypothesis:

```python
# Test different weightings
configs = [
    (0.5, 0.5),  # Equal weighting
    (0.6, 0.4),  # Current default
    (0.7, 0.3),  # Prioritize environment
    (0.4, 0.6),  # Prioritize goal
]

for env_w, goal_w in configs:
    memory = ProceduralMemory(MemoryConfig(env_weight=env_w, goal_weight=goal_w))
    # ... run benchmark suite ...
    # Compare recall quality
```

**Hypothesis**: 60/40 balances context awareness (environment) with task focus (goal).

## Learning Demo (Week 1 Target)

**Goal**: Show that an agent improves over multiple log analysis sessions.

**Plan**:
1. Create 3 log files with similar error patterns (database timeouts, cache failures, etc.)
2. Agent analyzes log 1, stores experiences
3. Agent analyzes log 2, recalls relevant experiences, faster analysis
4. Agent analyzes log 3, applies learned patterns, provides better insights

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Agent recalls relevant experiences from log 1 when analyzing log 2
- ✅ Analysis time decreases (agent knows what to look for)
- ✅ Insights improve (agent suggests fixes based on past patterns)

**Status**: ⏳ Pending (end of Week 1)
