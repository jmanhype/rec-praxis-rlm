{"id":"rec-praxis-rlm-v78","title":"Add iterative improvement mode for autonomous security fixes","description":"## Overview\nImplement coverage-driven iterative mode similar to Qodo-Cover's --max-iterations, but for security quality instead of test coverage.\n\n## Features\n- Run multiple LLM iterations until quality score target met\n- Each iteration learns from previous failures\n- Auto-suggest fixes for detected issues\n- Re-scan with fixes applied to validate improvement\n- Track quality score progression\n- Stop when target reached or max iterations hit\n\n## CLI Interface\n```bash\nrec-praxis-review src/app.py \\\n  --mode iterative \\\n  --max-iterations 5 \\\n  --target-score 95 \\\n  --auto-fix true\n```\n\n## How It Works\n1. First pass: Find security issues (baseline score: 60)\n2. Agent suggests fixes using procedural memory\n3. Apply fixes to code (or suggest to user)\n4. Re-scan with fixes applied (new score: 75)\n5. Iterate until quality score \u003e= 95% or max iterations\n\n## Quality Score Calculation\n- Weighted by severity (CRITICAL: 10pts, HIGH: 5pts, etc.)\n- Penalize high-risk patterns\n- Reward secure coding patterns\n- Track improvement over time\n\n## Value\nAutonomous security improvement, not just detection. \"Set it and forget it\" security.\n\n## Priority\nP1 - Differentiator from static tools\n\n## Estimated Effort\n1 week\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires test generation agent (rec-praxis-rlm-r7o)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T11:23:17.867223-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T12:40:31.876762-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T12:40:31.876762-06:00"}
